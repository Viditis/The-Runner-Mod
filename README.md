🧠 Full Description (Human-readable)
Chrono Boots give you godlike movement with 3 modes:

🔸 Travel Mode – Dash across land and water at insane speeds
🔸 Combat Mode – Freeze time itself: enemies, arrows, and more
🔸 Regular Mode – Walk like a mortal (but... why?)

Also includes:
🌀 Phasing Ability – Walk through walls, hover, and kill mobs in your path like a ghost

Perfect for speedrunners, fighters, and chaos enjoyers.
Built for Minecraft 1.20.1 (Fabric). Requires Fabric API.

“Why make this?” Because regular Minecraft movement is boring.
So I destroyed it.
